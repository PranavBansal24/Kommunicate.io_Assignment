Qs 5) If you are to start a software company, name 2 people from your batch whom you 
      will choose as your partner and why?

Ans)  If I have to start a software company with some of my friends from my batch,  
      then they would be Divyansh Dahiya and Tushar Chawla. We have worked as a 
      team many times and we have a good synergy, coordination and understanding.
      We have done some volunteering work togerther as well. So that's why I will 
      choose them.
